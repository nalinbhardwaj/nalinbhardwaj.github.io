Hi, I'm Nalin (UUID: nibnalin). Currently, I'm studying math and literature at UC San Diego, and hobbying in tech.

I use this space as an experimental ground to develop my own ideas and share them with others. I've found that I learn a lot more _in public_, so most of the things I write about here are rather weakly held opinions, or summarizations, meant to be treated as interesting indulgences, not defining beliefs.

I don't know who I want to be when I grow up. Eternally looking for an answer.
